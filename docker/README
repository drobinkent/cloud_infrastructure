  b) Install all dependencies for IoZone through docker
  c) Buid the IoZONE system
  d) run a sample Iozone bechmark report and save the report as a .xls file in the volume
  e) Stop the docker container. 
  f) Copy the benchmark report from the volume to current directory
  g) also copy the report directly from the container
